Built in class based views API

The class based views are divided into 

  Base views:
    - View
    - TemplateView
    - RedirectView

  Generic display views:
    - DetailsView
    - ListView

  Generic Editing views:
    - FormView
    - CreateView
    - UpdateView
    - DeleteView

  Generic date views:
    - ArchiveIndexView
    - DateDetailView
    - DayArchiveView
    - MonthArchiveView
    - WeekArchiveView
    - YearArchiveView


Class based views Mixins

  Simple mixins:
    - ContextMixin
    - TemplateResponseMixin

  Single Object mixins:
    - SingleObjectMixin
    - SingleObjectTemplateResponseMixin

  Multiple Object mixins:
    - MultipleObjectMixin
    - MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin
  
  Editing Mixins:
    - FormMixin
    - ModelFormMixin
    - ProcessFormView
    - DeletionMixin

  Date-based Mixins:
    - YearMixin
    - MonthMixin
    - DayMixin
    - WeekMixin
    - DateMixin
    - BaseDateListView





To proceed We have to Understand then innovate.

what are Mixins?

Mixins also known as mix-ins is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent.. 
Hmmmmm(Thinking emoji)

What does this mean because we know from inheritance, if class B inherites attributes and methods from class A then A is the  
the parent class of the inheriter B based on the "is-a" relationship. 

Here's the interesting thing Mixins are sometimes refered to as "included" rather than 
"inherited" since it doen't define a new type it shouldn't be inherited from

what does it do?
it encourages code reuse and can be used to avoid the ambiguity of multiple inheritance also know as the diamond problem. 
(hand on face)



what is the diamond problem.

So lets Talk about Django TemplateView and RedirectView.


TemplateView:
  inheritance-list:
    - TemplateResponseMixin
    - ContextMixin
    - View

  Methods:
    - get(): It renders a template with a keyword arguments from the URLconf to the context attribute.

  
TemplateResponseMixin: It's a mixin used to render a template.

  Attributes includes:
    - template_name: The template to render, templates are rendered with a context. 
    - template_engine: The template engine to use e.g Jinja used by flask and FastAPI
    - response_class: The class to use for the response. which is TemplateResponse by default.
    - content_type: The content type of the response.

  Methods:
    - get_template_names(): It checks to if a template name is assigned and returns the template,
      else it raise an ImproperlyConfigured exception.

    - render_to_response(): 













How to use generic views:
  - Using them directly in your URLconf
  - Creating Subclass from them and overiding their attributes or methods

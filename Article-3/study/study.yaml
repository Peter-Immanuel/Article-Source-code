Built in class based views API

The class based views are divided into 

  Base views:

    - TemplateView
    - RedirectView

  Generic display views:
    - DetailsView
    - ListView

  Generic Editing views:

    - DeleteView

  Generic date views:
    - ArchiveIndexView
    - DateDetailView
    - DayArchiveView
    - MonthArchiveView
    - WeekArchiveView
    - YearArchiveView

To proceed We have to Understand then innovate.

what are Mixins?

Mixins also known as mix-ins is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent.. 
Hmmmmm(Thinking emoji)

What does this mean because we know from inheritance, if class B inherites attributes and methods from class A then A is the  
the parent class of the inheriter B based on the "is-a" relationship. 

Here's the interesting thing Mixins are sometimes refered to as "included" rather than 
"inherited"

what does it do?
it encourages code reuse and can be used to avoid the ambiguity of multiple inheritance also know as the diamond problem. 
(hand on face)



what is the diamond problem.

Authorization:
  From wiki To authorize means to define an access policy. This access policy defines rules

  They use that to based on your level, they refare the access policy to see if to what extent can 
  your level access resources.


Authentication:
  Authentication is the process of verifying someone or something(I'm using something intensionaly) claim.
  So in tech world is verifying that such a person exist in our database and the credentials provided matches 
  those available, inturn the person is given an "Authorization level" to access the application.

  This authentication system could be part of the server (Monolithic) or a dedicated service(microservice)

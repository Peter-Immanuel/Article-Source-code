Concepts:
  - Authorization
  - Authentication
  - OAuth
  - OAuth versions
  - JWT and other OAuth options
  - JWT Authentication with FastAPI


Authorization:
  From wiki To authorize means to define an access policy. This access policy defines rules
  used to decide access should be granted to request from an authenticated user. 
  I guess in some of these military movies you hear things like "Whats your authorization level?"
  They use that to based on your level, they refare the access policy to see if to what extent can 
  your level access resources.


Authentication:
  Authentication is the process of verifying someone or something's claim(I'm using something intensionaly).
  So in the tech world it means verifying that such a person exist in our database and the credentials provided matches 
  those available, inturn the person is given allowed to access the application and its resources based on some 
  "Authorization level".

  This authentication system could be part of the server (Monolithic) or a dedicated service(microservice)


Commonly Used Authentication Factors:
  - Knowledge Factor: This  refers to something you know. typically username and password
  - Possession Factor: Something your have, a smard token or smard device
  - Inherence Factor: Something you are, an inherent biometric characteristics 
  - Location Factor: This factor is less common and isn't used alone, it suppliments other authentication methods
  - Time Factor: Similar to location, it isn't used seperately. It could be used to suppliment other identifying mechanism



Authentication Types:
  - Password-based Authentication: 
    This authentication generally includes only one authenticaton factor. Most time it's the knowldege. 
    Username and password. requiring you to provide your unique username and password

  - Multi-factor Authentication:
    This authentication involves using more than one AuthFactor for authentication, This could be
    knowledge factor as well as possession factor. 

  - Certificate-based Authentication:
    This authentication type uses digital certificates issued by certificate authority and Public key 
    cryptography to verify user identity

  - Biometric Authentication:
    This authentication type uses the Inherence factor for authentication. which could be finger print
    facial recognition, iris recognition.

  - Token-Based Authentication:
    This authentication involves the user exchanging their details (username and password) for a unique encrypted
    string of random characters.

  - Single Sign-on (SSO):
    this enables a user to use a single set of credentials to access multiple applications or website 
    The user creates an account with the Identity Provider (IdP). And whenever the user needs to use services
    provided by other service pro



OAuth:
  OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability 
  for “secure designated access.” OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization 
  tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is about authorization not authentication
  In Simple Terms:
    - Authorization is about asking for permission
    - Authentication is about verifying one's claim.

  Here's What the RFC says about OAuth; OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework which enables a third-party 
  application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating 
  an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HHTP service, or by allowing the third party 
  application to obtain access on its own behalf.  

  Prior to OAuth, credentials were shared between application making it extremely risky.
